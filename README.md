This repo includes 2 Arduino programs, developed for a scale model of an automated parking system proposed in Penn State's IE480 capstone design class. The scope of the project is summarized in the poster (.pdf file).

The rcLineFollower.ino was fully functional in our test environment, while the rcUltrasonicPositioning.ino file was not capable of meeting expectations. With more reliable ultrasonic sensors and a more robust positioning algorithm, we feel that the Ultrasonic Positioning concept can surpass the capabilities of the line follower.

See logic flow diagrams for a better conceptual understanding.
